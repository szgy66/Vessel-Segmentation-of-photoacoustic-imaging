# Vessel-Segmentation-of-photoacoustic-imaging
Vessel Segmentation; Python; Keras
This code is for paper "Deep learning approaches for vascular segmentation in Photoacoustic Imaging"

# About how to run this code
In this code, we put our images in a flie named content3 which including three file, "Aug-image","Aug-label","test" respectively.
if you want training/testing your own images, you should create image file and insure the image size is 256Ã—256 and 
change the path in our code which is in main.py and Hy-test.py.
